# Programming Challenge #2

## Description
In this challenge, you'll create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

## Difficulty
Easy (Beginner)

## Checklist
- [ ] Create a variable to store the result.
- [ ] Get user input for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, or /).
- [ ] Perform the corresponding operation on the two numbers.
- [ ] Display the result to the user.

## Additional Requirements
- Ensure that the calculator can handle division by zero gracefully and provide appropriate feedback to the user.
- Allow the user to continue performing calculations until they choose to exit.

## Submission
- [ ] Create a new folder in the `Submissions` folder with your name and the challenge number. (ex. `Submissions/John Doe/2`)
- [ ] Add your code to your folder.
- [ ] Create a file called `README.md` in your folder.
- [ ] Explain your code and how you handled division by zero in your `README.md` file.
- [ ] Create a pull request to the `master` branch.
- [ ] Wait for your pull request to be reviewed.
